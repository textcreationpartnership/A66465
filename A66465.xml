            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GReat and many are the Obligations (ſince Providence ſo order'd it) that moved me to requeſt your Patronage of theſe Poems, as I might thus variouſly inſtance. Firſt, in that Nature ſo far befriended my Birth, as to be a Native, both of your Neighbourhood, and County; Likewiſe upon
<pb facs="tcp:62738:4"/>that acquaintance, (and if I may ſo far preſume, I might ſtile if the intintate acquaintance) that I had with your Honour in the days of Infancy, and Minority of my Age; the renovation of which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in my Maturity or riper Years impos'd an Obligation upon me to Reverence, and Regard your Honourable Perſon, eſpecially when I had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of your late approach to <hi>London,</hi> and the Honour of your Courteous Viſit at my Habitation, before I had Information of your Abode; beſides theſe Obligations, I have a regard to ſome others in a more peculiar manner; namely thoſe Virtuous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications which manifeſted, and ſtill do manifeſt themſelves in the whole courſe of your Sober Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, (to wit) Meekneſs and Familiarity: with theſe foremention'd motives; More I might ſtill nominate, as touching your Candid Deportment towards my Parentage, and that Affection and Amity my Father continually enjoy'd from the Bounty of your Noble Progeny; all which were main Inducements, provoking my Ambition to ſhelter my ſlender Conceptions under the Ornament of your Patronage; and to further my attainment in this attempt, I obſerved the Caution of the wiſe man in <hi>Pro. 27. v. 10. Thine own Friend and thy Fathers Friend forſake not,</hi> or as I might fitly add, forget not; and to Reverence your Noble Name, to whom I am a Debtor in reſpect of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Affection and Gratitude, I conjectur'd it
<pb facs="tcp:62738:4"/>expedient to be the Memorial of this Dedication, by reaſon the firſt Fruits of my Intellectual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, flowing from a Divine Inſtinct, both in this; and the enſuing method: I muſt needs acknowledge it to be my great Encouragement and Satisfaction, in that I am Honoured with ſo worthy a Patron as your Generous and Ingenious ſelf, whoſe Virtue, Candor, and Affability, doubles your Honour, while others exalted to a higher degree, by Pride maculate their Promotion. May your Honour, as you are my Patron, be pleaſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe enſuing Poems, and may theſe Poems, be worthy your peruſal: The beſt Apology J can make in mine or their defence, is only this: That there are variety of Inferences, drawn from variety of Subjects, comprehended in this little Volume; ſome whereof may be ſmoother poliſhed than others, and thereby the more approveable: In caſe that if any be found knotty and unevan, I hope they may be the more diſpenſible, if obſerv'd as deriving from a Novice in the Potent Science of Poetry.</p>
            <p>I am dubious that your Diſcerning eye may find Imperfections in their Peruſual. But I had rather liſp and ſtammer forth the Praiſes of my God, than be bruitiſhly ſilent; yet muſt acknowledge the Theme deſerved an abler Poet, and I fear may in ſome places ſeem Maculated by my ruder Pen: Wherefore I am Importunate in the Imploration of your Candor, to Connive at my Miſdemeanours in
<pb facs="tcp:62738:5"/>all reſpects, and vouchſafe my Pardon from your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency for the preſumption of this Addreſs, and thoſe Expreſſions that ſtand in need either of Gravity or Gratitude in reference to your Parts and Perſon: Thus Craving your Honour to accept of my Will for the Deed; the which ſhall impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf a further Obligation, entituling me to remain acccording to the ſtile of this my ſincere Subſcription,</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Ingenious and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Dare be confident that the Compoſing of a Book, and the Expoſing thereof to the publick view of the World, is looked upon by the Cenſorious Captiouſneſs of this Critical Age, as a piece of the higheſt preſumption; eſpecially when it proves the firſt Fruits of its Author, by reaſon of the variety of eminent and Learned men, as well Ancient as Modern: Who derived their Diſcourſes almoſt from all Subjects imaginable; principally from the Sacred Records of Divinity, by Authentick and Orthodox extractions, in as much as their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and well Compoſed Volumes, have either Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaried, or Paraphras'd all the Commands, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, Promiſes and Examples, pertaining both to the Old and New Teſtaments; and this in ſuch an amplitude, that many mens opinions allow no ground to extract or derive any thing from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſave what have been treated of at large by others; though this be granted, yet I might ſay that we and the poſterity of theſe exemplary Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Piety, are not abſolutely created by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power; to live by the Induſtry and pains of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but rather as our Incumbent duty according to the Capacity of our endeavours, we ought to be Imitators of theſe Divines, as well in the Theorick,
<pb facs="tcp:62738:8"/>as in the Practick part of Divinity, provided we erre not from their fore-mention'd Authentick Doctrine; nor from ſuch Points and Principles as have a right correſpondency with Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Candid Reader, my Genius has ſo far preſumed, as to contrive in a Poetick method thoſe obſervations which I deriv'd from the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sacred Subjects: And becauſe I would not willingly be deceived by the firſt Fruits of my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings in this enterprize; I endeavoured to make choice of the beſt Baſis and ſureſt Foundation for my intended ſuperſtructure, namely the Eternal God; in hopes the attempting of ſo good a beginning would prove the means of attaining an happy End.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like Cogitations gain'd the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency over my Inclinations ſo far, as to inſiſt upon more Subjects of this Nature. For while I was muſing of God, and his goodneſs, I found even as the Pſalmiſt expreſt in <hi>Pſal. 100. v. 34. That my Meditation of him was ſweet:</hi> The oftner I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on Divine things, the more I was allured by them: The Subjects I pondered upon are very winning in themſelves, and ſo is the Method whereto I reduced them; and ſince thus mutually alluring, I conſidered they were meet exerciſes for my vacant hours: And indeed ſo I have found them in both theſe reſpects. First in my Reſtriction from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſſary Expences. Secondly in confining my mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to Caeleſtial than Terreſtial things.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62738:8"/>
            <p>But as touching the enſuing Poems, this is my requeſt to the Impartial Reader, that he would be pleaſed to connive at the Authors Frailty. For did he know his Inabilities, he ſhould have good reaſon to be very indulgent, and deſire no further Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy than this ingenious acknowledgment. That theſe are the firſt fruits of my unexperienced Pen, and therefore may be capable of Errata's: For though my will and deſigne aim'd no Error in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, yet the accompliſhing of theſe Intentions without an Error, exceeds the limits of humane frailty, the which I am too much guilty of.</p>
            <p>This little Volume conſiſts of ſeveral Subjects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the Contents of the Book, and the obſervable paſſages drawn as Inferences from theſe Subjects with other Additions, are in two Tables cited imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly following the Contents: And for the benefit of meaner Capacities and ſuch as want Memory, I have compil'd a Brief Alphabetical Expoſitor, and placed it at the end of the Book for the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the moſt difficult words that I have made uſe of in theſe Poems, leaſt the miſapprehenſion of ſome paſſages might cauſe their miſconſtructions. The which would expoſe the Book and the Author to greater Cenſure: Therefore Courteous Reader, be pleaſed to caſt a favourable eye upon theſe Poems, and where thou canſt truly reliſh them, give God the Praiſe, for that belongs to him: But where thou ſhalt find them ſavour of weakneſs and Imperfection,
<pb facs="tcp:62738:9"/>impute this to the Author, and he ſhall own it; but e're I leave, I conjecture it very expedient to render thee my experimental opinion, touching the Science or faculty of Divine Poetry. It is one of the beſt Companions a man can be acquainted with: I verily believe it is as much pleaſing to God as any Virtue pertaining to a Chriſtian, becauſe it tyes as it were the Head, Heart and Soul of a man to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Heavenly things; and if ſo, doubtleſs God is much Glorified by it: It activates a mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by repreſenting unto the mind Objects and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects meet for Meditation; it cauſes much Seriouſneſs, and Evacuates the mind of Vanity, and as a watchful Sentinel protects the Heart from the Stratagems of Satans Temptations. Theſe benefits in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I have experienced by it, through the bleſſing of God; and mayeſt thou in their peruſal experience the ſame likewiſe, ſo recommending it and thee to the Protection and Benediction of God, in hopes theſe my firſt Fruits may not prove fruitleſs: I ſhall take my leave and ſubſcribe my ſelf truely thine in love and ſervice, if thou art a ſincere Chriſtian, whilſt</p>
